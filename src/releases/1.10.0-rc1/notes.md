# DC/OS 1.10.0 Release Candidate 1

<div style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid black; background-color: #e3e4e5;">
<h2>This release candidate is for testing only and not to be used in production.</h2>
 <h3>Limitations:</h3>

<ul>
<li>You must upgrade Marathon-LB _before_ upgrading to DC/OS 1.10. See the [upgrade section](/1.10/installing/upgrading/) for more information.</li>

<li>During upgrade to 1.10, there is a brief moment when the DNS resolution does not work. If a health check runs at that moment, it will fail and services will be reported as unhealthy.</li>

</ul>
<br />
Please try out the new features and updated data services. Provide any feedback through Jira: https://jira.dcos.io.

DC/OS 1.10 includes many new capabilities for Operators and expands the collection of Data & Developer Services with a focus on:
- Core DC/OS Service Continuity - System resilience, cluster and node checks, UCR and Pods improvements.
- CNI Networking enhancements for broader networking support.
- Data Services enhancements.

# <a name="new-features"></a>New Features and Capabilities

## Apache Mesos 1.4 and Marathon 1.5 Integrated.
- DC/OS 1.10 is is based on Mesos 1.4.0, here using master branch (pre-release) SHA 013f7e21, with over 1200 commits since the previous Mesos version. View the [changelog](https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/CHANGELOG).

- DC/OS 1.10 is integrated with the latest release of Marathon, version 1.5. Resulting breaking changes and new features are documented below. For more information about Marathon 1.5, consult the [Marathon changelog](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/blob/master/changelog.md).

## Networking
- Configurable Spartan upstreams for domains (dnames).
  You can now configure Spartan to delegate a particular domain (e.g. "\*.foo.company.com") to a particular upstream. <!-- I could use more information here -->

- Increased CNI network support.
  DC/OS now supports any type of CNI network. [View the documentation](/docs/1.10/networking/virtual-networks/cni-plugins/).

## Platform
- Node and Cluster health checks.
  Write your own custom health checks or use the predefined checks to access and use information about your cluster, including available ports, Mesos agent status, and IP detect script validation. [View the documentation](/docs/1.10/installing/custom/node-cluster-health-check/).
- Enhanced upgrades with pre/post flight checks.
- Universal Container Runtime (UCR).
  Adds port mapping support for containers running on the CNI network. Port mapping support allows UCR to have a default bridge network, similar to Docker's default bridge network. This gives UCR feature parity with Docker Engine enabling use of Mesos Runtime as the default container runtime. [View the documentation](/docs/1.10/deploying-services/containerizers/).
- Scale and performance limits.

## CLI

- DC/OS 1.10.0 requires DC/OS CLI 0.5.x.
- DC/OS CLI 0.5.x adds [multi-cluster support](/1.10/cli/multi-cluster-cli/) with [`dcos cluster`](/1.10/cli/command-reference/dcos-cluster) commands. Multi-cluster support has a number of consequences:

   - DC/OS CLI 0.4.x and 0.5.x use a different structure for the location of configuration files. DC/OS CLI 0.4.x has a single configuration file, which by default is stored in `~/.dcos/dcos.toml`. DC/OS CLI 0.5.x has a configuration file for each connected cluster, which by default are stored in `~/.dcos/clusters/<cluster_id>/dcos.toml`.
   - DC/OS CLI 0.5.x introduces the `dcos cluster setup` command to configure a connection to a cluster and log into the cluster.
   - **Note:**
     -  Updating to the DC/OS CLI 0.5.x and running any CLI command triggers conversion from the old to the new configuration structure.
     - _After_ you call `dcos cluster setup`, (or after conversion has occurred), if you attempt to update the cluster configuration using a `dcos config set` command, the command prints a warning message saying the command is deprecated and cluster configuration state may now be corrupted.
  - If you have the `DCOS_CONFIG` environment variable configured:
    - After conversion to the new configuration structure, `DCOS_CONFIG` is no longer honored.
    - _Before_ you call `dcos cluster setup`, you can change the configuration pointed to by `DCOS_CONFIG` using `dcos config set`. This command prints a warning message saying the command is deprecated and recommends using `dcos cluster setup`.

## GUI
The GUI sidebar tabs have been updated to offer a more intuitive experience.

- The "Deployments" subpage under the "Services" tab has been moved to a toggle-able modal in the "Services" page.
- The "Universe" tab has been renamed to "Catalog" and the "Installed" subpage has been removed.
- The "System Overview" tab has been renamed to "Overview".

## Updated DC/OS Data Services

- Rolling Configuration Update and Upgrades support via CLI.
- Ability to deploy Data Services into Folders to enable multi team deployments.
- Ability to deploy to CNI-Based Virtual Networks.

The following updated data services packages are also in beta and are compatible with DC/OS 1.10.

- Beta Elastic. [Documentation](https://docs.mesosphere.com/service-docs/beta-elastic/v1.0.15-5.5.1-beta/). [Release Notes](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-commons/releases/tag/elastic-1.0.15-5.5.1-beta).

- Beta HDFS. [Documentation](https://docs.mesosphere.com/service-docs/beta-hdfs/v1.3.3-2.6.0-cdh5.11.0-beta/). [Release Notes](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-commons/releases/tag/hdfs-1.3.3-2.6.0-cdh5.11.0-beta).

- Beta Kafka. [Documentation](https://docs.mesosphere.com/service-docs/beta-kafka/v1.1.26-0.10.1.0-beta/). [Release Notes](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-commons/releases/tag/kafka-1.1.26-0.10.1.0-beta).

- Apache Spark. [Documentation](https://docs.mesosphere.com/service-docs/spark/v1.1.1-2.2.0/). [Release Notes](https://github.com/mesosphere/spark-build/releases/tag/1.1.1-2.2.0).

# Breaking Changes

- Marathon Networking API Changes in 1.5
  The networking section of the Marathon API has changed significantly in version 1.5. Marathon can still accept requests using the 1.4 version of the API, but it will always reply with the 1.5 version of the app definition. This will break tools that consume networking-related fields of the service definition. [View the documentation](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/blob/master/docs/docs/networking.md). <!-- linking to the marathon doc until I port the relevant information to the dc/os site -->

- The latest version of Marathon-LB is required for 1.10.
  Before upgrading to 1.10, uninstall your existing Marathon-LB package and reinstall the updated version. See the [upgrade section](/docs/1.10/installing/upgrading/) for more information.

- REX-Ray configuration change.
  DC/OS 1.10 upgrades REX-Ray from v03.3. to v0.9.0 and therefore the REX-Ray configuration format has changed. If you have specified custom REX-Ray configuration in the `REX-Ray_config` parameter of your `config.yaml` file, change the parameter to `REX-Ray_config_preset: aws`.

- New flow to change the `dcos_url` and login.
  The new command to change your cluster URL is `dcos cluster setup <dcos_url>`. This change will break any existing tooling that uses the former command. Backwards compatibility is slated for a future patch release.

- Marathon Jenkins Plugin and Marathon-Client.
  Marathon 1.5, released with DCOS 1.10, made breaking changes to the API around Docker and management of networks. This breaking change has not yet been incorporated in the marathon-client, which is used by the marathon jenkins plugin. Marathon client and Marathon Jenkins Plugin _will_ work in general, however they will _fail_ to propagate configurations for networks if working with DCOS 1.10 or Marathon 1.5. A solution will be provided for the DCOS 1.10 GA release.
