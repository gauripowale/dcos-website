# Abstract

For this meetup we are excited to be joined by three great speakers from Yelp! In this presentation, Sunil Shah, Kyle Kelly and Timmy Zhu will present Jolt, a system that aims to solve the problem of running integration tests with a high fixed resource cost at scale. We use Mesos plus a custom open source framework called Task Processing to run integration tests for the Yelp website in a massively parallel manner - taking test runs down from a few days to less than an hour.
