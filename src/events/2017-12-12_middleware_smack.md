# Abstract

In this workshop, the participants will build their own microservice application and connect it to a Fast Data Pipeline consisting of Apache Spark, Cassandra, and Kafka. This pipeline will then deployed on top of DC/OS. We will also look into the operational aspects of updating, scaling, and monitoring such data pipelines.

What to expect:
* Best practices for setting up Fast Data Pipelines
* The different components of the SMACK stack and respective alternatives
* How to deploy such stack in an efficient and fault-tolerant way
* How to keep such stacks running:
* Monitoring
* Upgrades
* Debugging
