# Abstract

This workshop provides an overview of deploying and operating modern microservice architectures at scale. We will discuss best practices for developing, deploying, and maintaining a microservice based application (e.g., upgrades, monitoring).

Participants will learn about:

* How to setup and deploy a Microservice architecture on DC/OS
* Alternative systems such as Kubernetes and Docker Swarm
* Best practices for Microservice architectures
* Best practices for Day 2 Operations (monitoring and maintaining the application): Monitoring, Upgrades, Debugging
